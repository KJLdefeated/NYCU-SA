# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace the line below with your
# domain name.

# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
#localhost {
#		# Set this path to your site's directory:
#		root * /usr/local/www/caddy
#
#		# Enable the static file server:
#		file_server
#
#		# Set up a reverse proxy:
#		# reverse_proxy localhost:8080
#
#		# Serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
#		# php_fastcgi localhost:9000
#
#		# Enable logging:
#		log {
#				output file /var/log/caddy/access.log
#				# Caddy's structured log format:
#				format json
#				# Or, for Common Log Format:
#				# format single_field common_log
#		}
#}

# Caddy will automatically obtain ACME certs for domains
# example.com {
#     root * /path/to/example.com
#     file_server
# }
{
    http_port 80
